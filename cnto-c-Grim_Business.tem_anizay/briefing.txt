// === SITUATION ===

The region of Anizay has been in turmoil for the past two years - two opposing factions have carved up the province. The local religious extremist group <marker name='marker_4'>Golden Tiger</marker> controls the industrious North, they are hostile, numerous and well armed but lack discipline and coordination. 
 
A Russian mercenary company called the <marker name='marker_12'>Devil Dogs</marker> seized the opportunity of the current conflict and occupied the rural South, forcing locals to grow opium in order to fund their expansion. The Devil Dogs are roughless and cunning, but currently are limited by their size and equipment, thus favouring hit and run attacks over all-out assaults.   
 
Two weeks ago the Golden Tigers managed to capture the Governor of Anizay and they are threatening to behead him if the US Army does not abandon its last two FOBs <marker name='respawn_west'>Nauzad</marker> and <marker name='marker_10'>Obeh</marker>. Despite our intelligence services best efforts we could not locate the Governor. Time is running short. HQ has agreed to a shady deal with the Devil Dogs - a truck (HEMTT) full of equipment and three crates of modern launchers for the intel we need to mount a rescue operation. 
 
They have agreed to meet us on neutral ground: the town of <marker name='marker_23'>Makan Aljamal</marker>.
